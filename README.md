# Northcoders News API

After cloning the repo, to successfully connect to the databases locally you will need to add two `.env` files specifying the databases:

Make a `.env.development` file with contents `PGDATABASE=nc_news` to get access to the running database.

Make a `.env.test` file with contents `PGDATABASE=nc_news_test` to get access to the testing database, which is used when running `npm run test` which tests all the endpoints.
